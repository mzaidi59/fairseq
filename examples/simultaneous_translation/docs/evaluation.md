# Introduction to the evaluation interface
The simultaneous translation models from the shared task participants are evaluated under a server-client protocol. The participants are required to plug in their own model API in the protocol, and submit a Docker image.

## Server-Client Protocol
A server-client protocol that will be used in evaluation. For example, when a *wait-k* model (k=3) translates the English sentence "Alice and Bob are good friends" to German sentence "Alice und Bob sind gute Freunde." , the evaluation process is shown in the following figure. 

### Server
The server code is provided and can be set up locally for development purposes. For example, to evaluate a text simultaneous test set,

```shell
python $user_dir/eval/server.py \
    --tokenizer 13a \
    --src-file $src \
    --tgt-file $tgt \
    --scorer-type {text, speech} \
    --output $result_dir/eval \
    --port 12321
```
The `--score-type` can be either `text` or `speech` to evaluation different tasks.

The state that server sends to the client has the following format
```json
{
  'sent_id': Int,
  'segment_id': Int,
  'segment': String or speech utterance
}
```
For text, the segment is a detokenized word, while for speech, it is a list of numbers.

### Client
The client will handle the evaluation process mentioned above. It should be out-of-box as well. The client's protocol is as following table.  The segment_size the length of segment in milisecond.

|Action|Content|
|:---:|:---:|
|Request new word| ```{key: "GET", value: None}```|
|Request new utterence | ```{key: "GET", value: {"segment_size": segment_size}}```|
|Predict word "W"| ```{key: "SEND", value: "W"}```|

The core of the client module is the agent, which needs to be modified for different models accordingly. The abstract class of agent is as follow, the evaluation process for one sentence happens in the `_decode_one()` function.

```python
class Agent(object):
    "an agent needs to follow this pattern"
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        ...

    def init_states(self):
        # Initializing states
        ...

    def update_states(self, states, new_state):
        # Update states with given new state from server
        # format of the new_state
        # {
        #   'sent_id': Int,
        #   'segment_id': Int,
        #   'segment': String or speech utterance
        # }
        ...

    def finish_eval(self, states, new_state):
        # Check if evaluation is finished
        ...
    
    def policy(self, state: list) -> dict:
        # Provide a action given current states
        # The action can only be either
        # Speech {key: "GET", value: {"segment_size": segment_size}}
        # Text {key: "GET", value: None}
        # or
        # {key: "SEND", value: W}
        ...

    def reset(self):
        # Reset agent
        ...
        
 def _decode_one(self, session, sent_id):
        action = {}
        self.reset()
        states = self.init_states()
        while action.get('value', None) != DEFAULT_EOS:
            # take an action
            action = self.policy(states)
            if action['key'] == GET:
                new_states = session.get_src(sent_id, action["value"])
                states = self.update_states(states, new_states)

            elif action['key'] == SEND:
                session.send_hypo(sent_id, action['value'])
                    states = self.init_states() 
                    self.reset()
            else:
                raise NotImplementedError

 
```
Here are the implementations of agents for [text *wait-k* model](../eval/agents/simul_trans_text_agent.py) and [speech *wait-k* model](../eval/agents/simul_trans_speech_agent.py).

## Quality
The quality is measured by detokenized BLEU. So make sure that the predicted words sent to server are detokenized. An implementation can be found [here](../eval/agent.py)

### Latency
The latency metrics are 
* Average Proportion
* Average Lagging
* Differentiable Average Lagging

For text, they will be evaluated on detokenized text. For speech, they will be evaluated based on millisecond
